# fixhub
enhance the github experience

adds 3 primary features:
- hide the assignee column
- show author profile pic
- show reviewers avatar with a status border (toggle to show username)
    - green = approved 
    - yellow = comment or stale review
    - red = changes requested
    - grey = assigned /w no interactions

optional github PAT, make sure to only give PR read access.

there is a scraping option to bypass the need for a key

there is no data collection or communication with external services (asside from the github api obviously)
